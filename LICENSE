The DocuSign .NET Client includes documentation for one or more DocuSign application programming interfaces (collectively the "APIs"), which may be further defined in API-specific Terms of Use ("TOU"), and any software code provided by DocuSign in conjunction with such documentation.  The DocuSign .NET Client is made available by DocuSign to assist developers in integrating certain functionality of the DocuSign services made available through the APIs (the "Services") into applications.  This agreement applies to any updates, supplements or support services for the DocuSign .NET Client, unless other terms accompany those items.  If so, those other terms apply.

Your Authorized Applications: will include functionality that enables end users to access and use all features available through the Services; will not include any independent features or functionality that are substantially similar to or compete with the functionality available through the Services; and will not provide access to or promote any services that are substantially similar to or compete with the Services.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreement to the contrary, DocuSign may also, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend access to the APIs and Services to You or any end user at any time.  You acknowledge that termination and/or monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy if You breach this agreement and that DocuSign will be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach.  This Section and Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 will survive termination of this agreement or any discontinuation of the offering of the DocuSign .NET Client, APIs or Services, along with any other provisions that would reasonably be deemed to survive such events.
